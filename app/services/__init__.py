"""
Services Package

Contains business logic and service layer components. Services handle
complex operations, coordinate between different parts of the application,
and contain reusable business logic.

Services typically:
- Handle complex business operations
- Coordinate between models, external APIs, and other services
- Contain reusable logic that might be used by multiple endpoints
- Abstract database operations from the API layer

Future services might include:
- user_service.py: User management operations
- message_service.py: Message handling and processing
- auth_service.py: Authentication and authorization logic
- websocket_service.py: WebSocket connection management
